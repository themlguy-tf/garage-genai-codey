Generative AI: Unleashing AI-powered Applications
Join the Google Cloud Garage Team for an exciting event, "Generative AI: Unleashing AI-powered Applications." The agenda includes recap sessions about Generative AI on Google Cloud and Gen AI-powered applications with embeddings and vector databases. Participants will also learn about building in minutes using the Gen App Builder, which enables Google-quality search experiences and conversational interactions.

Codey APIs, which offer functionalities for code generation, code chat, and code completion, will be showcased with interactive demos. Participants will have the opportunity to engage in a hands-on lab, integrating Codey APIs with Code Editor Tools.
